// to print the variable on the console or any string on the console we have to use the console.log in javascript

console.log("Hello World and welcome to javascript");

console.log("Radhakrushna Mahadik");

console.log("You are here because you deserved!");

// console.log() will always print the code on new line and hence we dont need to add any extra new line character

// alert("Are you okay?");

// variables are used to store the values inside them
// They will be assigned the memory based on the datatype present there

age = 22; 
my_name = "Radhakrushna Mahadik";
score = 96.53;
// Variables can be declared without using any datatype and hence it can be considered as dynamically typed language

console.log("Hello my age is " + age);
console.log("Hello my age is" , age);
// To add the two strings we can use + symbol or we can even use , operator and hence we can use both to print on the console
// Major difference between + operator or , operator is that + operator will not add any white space and it will just concanate the string to the variable and hence we have to expliciltly add the white space out there
// But when we use the , operator the white space will be added to the variable no matter what

console.log("My name is", my_name);
console.log("My score is " + score);
